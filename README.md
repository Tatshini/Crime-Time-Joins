# Crime-Time-Joins
Play with relational joins

## About
This repository provides a fun and interactive example of relational joins and demonstrates how to connect to a PostgreSQL database using Python.
The idea is to use several pieces of evidence hidden in separate tables to find the culprit of a crime. The relational joins will reveal the culprit. 

## Pre-requisites

You should have python and pip, both version 3 installed in your system.
You should have postgresql installed. Make sure an instance is running in the background.
No data is required, all of the data is created in the .sql file.

## Setup

Run the following command on terminal: pip install psycopg

Clone this repository and update the configuration values in user_config.py file

## Execution

To see a few examples of relational joins, see our previous example: [python relational_joins.py](https://github.com/Tatshini/Relational-Joins-Explained)


## Extra

To explore other pieces of evidence, you could set Earrings="N", color='red' and see how the culprit changes.
